##What is Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that analyzes and models data without labelled responses or predefined categories. Unlike supervised learning, where the algorithm learns from input-output pairs, unsupervised learning algorithms work solely with input data and aim to discover hidden patterns, structures or relationships within the dataset independently, without any human intervention or prior knowledge of the data's meaning.

The image shows set of animals like elephants, camels and cows that represents raw data that the unsupervised learning algorithm will process.

*The "Interpretation" stage signifies that the algorithm doesn't have predefined labels or categories for the data. It needs to figure out how to group or organize the data based on inherent patterns.
*An algorithm represents unsupervised learning process which can be clustering, dimensionality reduction or anomaly detection to identify patterns in the data.
*The processing stage shows the algorithm working on the data.
*The output shows the results of the unsupervised learning process. In this case, the algorithm might have grouped the animals into clusters based on their species (elephants, camels, cows).
